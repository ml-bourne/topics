### Motivation

We all want to learn 'all the things' but don't necessarly get enough time to do so.
In this document, list the programming/data related topics that are on your radar.
Each week one of us can pick a topic (not limited to this list) and run us through an example, preferably hands-on (if it applies).

## List of topics

### Docker

> Docker looks to be the choice solution to distribute the environment necessary to run your pipeline,
  wether on a cluster or increasingly on cloud platforms.

* Overview of the use of Docker on GPC clusters and cloud: comparison to VMs
  * http://www.thoughtsoncloud.com/2015/06/controlling-cloud-computing-costs-with-containers/
* Using docker for a bioinformatics workflow: small overhead of 4% (extra time) compared to not using Docker
  * http://www.nextflow.io/blog/2014/using-docker-in-hpc-cluster.html
* Latest Docker plugins + demo
  * http://plugins-demo-2015.github.io/
* Slides from DockerCon 2015
  * http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/

### How I work?

> We come from various backgrounds, and the way we work was developped by trial and error, internet readings and
  show and tell. How about sharing this with others? 1) Show how you work to teach others the tips and tricks you
  found out about along the way, 2) Show how you work and maybe get a suggestion on improving part of your workflow.

* Some links started recently listing "your favorite Python idioms": neat little Python tricks you use constantly

### REST and RESTful APIs

> One way to obtain data in a ready computer readable format is to access it via REST. But what is REST, how do I
  run it: show me examples! (including websites that make it available)

* What is REST anyway

* Some information on how to use the REST API from the protein data bank database

### Pandas

> This one is obvious, if somehow you're abe to use pandas as the extension of your mind, you're in a good spot. So let's work our way there! This would most likely be a recuring topic.

### Anaconda/Conda

> Anaconda and Conda are getting more and more established as the hassle-free way to install Python these days. But why is that, what does it do better than other methods. And how can I create my own Conda package?

### Kaggle / Otto challenge

> The Otto challenge deadline is past, and workflows for it have been released. Let's have a look and learn from
  the best!
